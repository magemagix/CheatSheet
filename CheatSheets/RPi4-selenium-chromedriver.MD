## 🖥️ My Configuration (The Beginning)

First things first! Let's start by making sure your Raspberry Pi 4 is prepped and ready for action. I’m running the **latest recommended Raspberry Pi OS** (64-bit) straight from the **Debian Trixie** branch. 🌟

### 🖱️ System Configuration:

Here’s what I used:

  * Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)

  * A port of Debian Trixie with the Raspberry Pi Desktop (Recommended)


After flashing the OS image onto my **microSD card**, I popped it into my Pi, hit power, and... boom! Time to update the system to make sure everything is fresh and spiffy. 💻✨
