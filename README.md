## 🎮 GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB on Ubuntu 24.04 🖥️

Ready to unleash the full power of your **GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB** on **Ubuntu 24.04**? 🔥 Whether you're gaming, rendering, or diving into AI, this GPU is a beast. 💪 But getting everything working smoothly with Ubuntu and NVIDIA drivers? Well, that’s a different adventure!

**Special Note:** For some strange reason, I couldn’t install **Ubuntu 24.04** directly on my system with the **RTX 5060 Ti**. I’ve tried all sorts of options, dove into the boot settings, and followed every suggestion, but no luck! 😩. It froze during and after installation. So, I took a shortcut: Installed **Ubuntu 22.04** first and upgraded to **24.04**. (If you have the same issue, now you know the trick! 😅)

### 🧩 What’s Inside:

* **Step-by-step instructions** for installing **Ubuntu 24.04** when you can't install it directly with an RTX 5060 Ti.
* A clever **trick** to install the **NVIDIA driver** correctly, even when standard installation methods fail. 🧙‍♂️
* How to set up **CUDA** and **cuDNN** for smooth GPU operations. 💻
* Installing **PyTorch** with GPU support so your tensors can run as fast as your GPU can handle! ⚡
* **Post-update problems**: If you update Ubuntu and everything breaks (again), I’ve got a way to purge and reinstall your NVIDIA drivers to make things right. 🧹

Ready to get your GPU working? Then check out the **[GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB Cheat Sheet](CheatSheets/GeForce-RTX-5060-Ti-Ubuntu-24.04.md)** for all the details! 🎮
